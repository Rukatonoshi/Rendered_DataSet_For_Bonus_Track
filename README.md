# Rendered_DataSet_For_Bonus_Track

## Description
I use "IP Network Traffic Flows Labeled with 75 Apps" dataset from kaggle as my final project for "Bonus Track" program, but this dataset is just too big (1.7 Gb).
So, before moving it to Google Collab file I decided to render it and reduce weight of this DataSet.

The initial dataset contained: 3577296 rows and 87 columns.
Rendered version contains: 170000 rows and  78 columns.

## Files
`Prepared_csv.py` - python script to render\prepare data from initial csv file\
`rendered_dataset.csv` - rendered version
